          </h2>
          <p>I am currently restoring a 1984 Jeep CJ-7. While serving as a chair member of Reel Productions Film Society at the University of Delaware, I assisted in the production of several short films and public service announcements. I was the first Meal & Travel Manager of the University of Delaware Marching Band and literally wrote the book on how to feed and transport the band. I am a black belt in Kenpo karate and am currently studying Arnis and Bo. I enjoy traveling to and learning about historic places.</p>
